battle system:
battle size is max size of 5 at a time, but enemy count is not limited, as enemy dies next will come on
each character (heroes and enemies) will have an initiative or speed rating that will determine their attack order
there are items, attack, abilities, and specials
some battles will have special events or triggers that must be done to change the fight into its next stage

leveling system:
xp based leveling, combats earn xp
each character template has base stats that get updated per level (not always the same stat every level)
preset templates provide base skills and abilities but additional skills and abilities will be based on level unlocks and then players choices
certain items will have level requirements attached

skill system:
skill tree where each choice has branching options that expand upon the base node
you don't have to keep going down a path
some nodes have an either or choice, once you select one path the other path gets locked
some skills level up to become stronger, some skills evolve into a new skill that replaces the old (retains original skill but adds some new feature to it)
